# Conventions

In order to match our coding style, make sure you:
 - adhere to the editorconfig; common IDE's have support natively or through addons.
 - to sort alphabetically Yaml's files and respect identation. You should use [Atom](https://atom.io/) and add [Yaml-Sortkey](https://atom.io/packages/yaml-sortkey) package.
